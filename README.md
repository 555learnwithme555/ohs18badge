### Description
OSH Park will be producing electronic conference badges for the [2018 Open Hardware Summit](http://2018.oshwa.org/) on September 27th at MIT

The current concept is to have:
* SiFive FE310 microcontroller which implements the RISC-V instruction set
* E-Paper to display the badge wearer's name
* Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) module to allow badge wearer to update the displayed text from an Android or iOS phone
* Alternate idea: use NFC instead of BLE

Quantity 300 badges are required for OHS 2018 on September 27th.

Maximum total budget per badge is: $25
(that will have to include components, batteries, PCB, assembly, lanyard, packaging)

Production plan:
The badge circuit boards will be pick-n-place assembled by a professional assembly service. A test jig will need to be created for the assembler to test the badges.

Production deadline:
September 1st, 2018
